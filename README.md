## 👋 Oh Hai there! 👋

### My Name is Mike Fallesen (He/Him/His) and you've stumbled across my github page.

## 📝 About Me:
  I'm a developer with 4+ years experience building websites for clients. I decided to improve my skills by getting a certificate in Full Stack Engineering from the University of Washington. I really enjoy building applications that use Node.js as well as React.js to keep myelf busy between jobs.  

  When I'm not coding I can usually be found either reading, gaming or painting miniatures. I also enjoy the outdooors and take my family camping and hiking whenever possible. 

Here you're going to find some of my personal projects along with projects I've completed for both clients and for bootcamp all in various states of completion (or lack thereof).

👀 Feel free to take a look around 👀 .
